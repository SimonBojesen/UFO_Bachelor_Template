\section{Finding Requirements of Bachelor Thesis}
I first searched on Moodle under "Mit studie SOFT" and reached the page: \url{https://cphbusiness.mrooms.net/course/view.php?id=746#section-8}{\label{label:link1}},
which has the \href{https://datsoftlyngby.github.io/soft2020fall/resources/bbe51cf2-bachelorProject.pdf}{recommendations and requirements pdf} that I will base my work upon.
Furthermore on section-1 of "Mit studie SOFT" you can reach the \href{https://www.cphbusiness.dk/media/78342/pba_soft_cba_curriculum_2017.pdf}{Curriculum Software Development pdf document} with official requirements for the bachelor project on page 17.

\section{Requirements for the Project and the Report}

\subsection{Curriculum}
\label{sec:curriculum}
The curriculum is listed in the \href{https://www.cphbusiness.dk/media/78342/pba_soft_cba_curriculum_2017.pdf}{aforementioned curriculum document}. 

\subsection{The Project}
\label{sec:project}
In the \href{https://datsoftlyngby.github.io/soft2020fall/resources/bbe51cf2-bachelorProject.pdf}{recommendations and requirements pdf} the following rules, recommendations and explanations are laid out:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Strive to \textbf{include elements from courses passed}.
	\item Group size is \textbf{maximum 4 students}. Larger groups carry larger expectations.
	\item The 15 ECTS points the project covers should amount to \textbf{412.5 hours} of project work.
\end{itemize}


\iffalse
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Strive to include elements from courses passed
	\item Group size is maximum 4 students.
\end{enumerate}
\fi

\subsection{Report}
\label{sec:report}
As before, the Report requirements are found in the \href{https://datsoftlyngby.github.io/soft2020fall/resources/bbe51cf2-bachelorProject.pdf}{recommendations and requirements pdf}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item The maximum page count for the report is:\\$maxPageCount = 40 + 20 \cdot numberOfStudents$.\\Meaning that a single student can write up to 60 pages and two students can write 80, etc.
	\item The report can be written in either \textbf{Danish or English}.
	\item The report \textbf{must} contain a thorough description of the work that has been done during the bachelor project, as well as an evaluation and reflectionon the work.
\end{itemize}
The requirements of the report were addressed here, while the recommendations will be followed in Task 2.
